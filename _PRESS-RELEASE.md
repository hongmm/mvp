There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Twitter tracker

## Sub-Heading ##
  > A quick way for users to view multiple real time stream of public tweets based on filter of choice

## Summary ##
  > This product is designed for those that do not want keep multiple tabs opened up on their browser for the latest tweets. This product is also designed for users to view multiple streams of tweets at once in a simple layout, enabling users to keep track of multiple topics at once. Users will be able to customize their filter queries to track the exact tweets they want to keep tabs on and place the views side by side to do direct comparisons.

## Problem ##
  > Twitter already provides instant updates for the users/tags/topics you are currently viewing. However, if someone wished to view real time updates for said topics, they would have to open up multiple pages and keep track of the streams individually.

## Solution ##
  > This product aims to provide a clean interface in which a user can visualize the stream of real live tweets for multiple topics. Users will be able to add or remove streams of the topics and filters they choose and easily compare the two side by side without having to open up multiple tabs.

## Quote from You ##
  > I love reading up on the latest trends on twitter but I always felt that it was rather cumbersome to have to have multiple tabs open to keep track of all the tweets that are coming in, especially with how quickly tweets are tweeted for certain topics. My aim to remove all the annoyances involved by giving users a simple UI to customize and setup to track all their favorite topics.

## How to Get Started ##
  > Getting started is super simple. Just visit the website and add in the topic you wish to track along with several customization options.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > I sincerely hope that this product will be of benefit to all the users and provide an easy method of viewing tweets. I myself am not a heavy user of twitter and use this tool myself to help organize the tweets I view. If you have any interest, please go visit our website and give it a quick spin and let me know what you think of this product!
